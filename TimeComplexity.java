// Time and Space Complexity

/************ TIME COMPLEXITY ***********/
/* 
Order Complexity Analysis:
* Amount of Space or time taken up by an algorithm/Code as function of input
size.
* Not the acutal time taken.

* SORTED ARRAY: Perform Constant Operation.
Case 1 -> Array Size (Increase), Time (Increase)
Case 2 -> Array Size (Increase), Time is Constant:  MORE EFFICIENT

* For Time Complexity: If we want to check on any program -> We need to see the
WORST CASE.
* Linear Search = O(n).  Graph: y = ax + b.

* CONSTANT TIME COMPLEXITY: Find largest and smallest array: TC ->>> O(1).

* 1. BIG O Notation: Upper Bound -> Worst Case T.C
 (BIG O: If someone ask what's the t.c of the program, Always we need to tell the Big O Notation TC (Worst Case).
 Graph: an^2 + bn + c.


 * 2. BIG OMEGA: Lower Bound T.C
 (BIG Omega: omega(n^2) is Best Case for this).
 (Omeag(n) and Omega(1) is not possible).

 * 3. BIG THETA: Average Bound T.C 
 (Like, Upper is Big 0 and lower is Omega: In between: Average: BIG Theta).
 (Theta(n^2): Average T.C).

 NOTE: 1. Small O, Small Omega and Small Theta is not important Time Complexity for the Placement purpose.
       2. Tightly Time complexity: BIG O. and Loosly Time Complexity: Small 0.
       Example of point 2: Height of the person (If we tell between 6ft to 5ft: TIGHTLY TIME COMPLEXITY),
                           Height of the person (If we tell between 1inch to 10ft: LOOSLY TIME COMPLEXITY).
